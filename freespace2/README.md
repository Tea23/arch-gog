As there is already a large community built around the source port,
the Freespace 2 Source Code Project, this GOG package merely depends
on the preexisting infrastructure. The SCP's releases are by far the
best way to play Freespace 2 on Linux.

(Really, I am sorry about screwing up the nice shiny gog-stuff format;
it's just that it'd get kinda odd quick dealing with the retail CD, which
is something nice to have especially once this is added to the SCP's own
wiki ._.)

More information on the FS2 SCP is available at:

 - fs2_open: FS2 SCP Release 3.6.14
 - fs2_open-svn: FS2 SCP SVN Trunk
 - fs2_open-data: Retail Freespace 2 game data (1.9 GiB installed)
 - fs2_open-mediavps: Extensive audiovisual enhancements (2.9 GiB installed)
 - fs2_open-wxlauncher: GUI settings/mod manager, doesn't play nice with the other packages right now ...

Mod PKGBUILDs will be available on my own github repo or on the aur (search for fs2_open).
