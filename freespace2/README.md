As there is already a large community built around the source port,
the Freespace 2 Source Code Project, this GOG package merely depends
on the preexisting infrastructure. The SCP's releases are by far the
 best way to play Freespace 2 on Linux.

More information on the FS2 SCP is available at:

 - fs2_open: FS2 SCP Release 3.6.14
 - fs2_open-svn: FS2 SCP SVN Trunk
 - fs2_open-data: Retail Freespace 2 game data
 - fs2_open-wxlauncher: GUI settings/mod manager, doesn't play nice with the other packages right now ...

Mod PKGBUILDs to come!
